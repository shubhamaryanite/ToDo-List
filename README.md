# ToDo-List
JavaScript Project

Made A To-Do List Project

It helps a user in taking down notes for important events
It helps a user in rembering the things that need to be done later on
It helps a user to remind them about their remaining work

The project uses a technology/framework of :
1)HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)  -- Defining the structure of the poject
2)CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)       -- For applying styles and animations
3)JavaScript                         -- For making a page responsive

I have attached a screenshot of the project too in this repository along with all the other files
